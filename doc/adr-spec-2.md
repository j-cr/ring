# Architecture Decision Record for Ring Spec 2.0

This is a record of the decisions that have gone into the Ring 2.0
specification. As of writing, the specification is still a draft, and
should not be considered finalized.

## Keyword Namespaces

The most obvious change in the 2.0 draft specification is that the
keys for request and response maps are now namespaced.

This change updates the request and response maps to be more in line
with the future direction of Clojure. Core libraries such as Spec, and
tools from Cognitect such as Datomic make extensive use of namespaced
keywords. In addition the language itself has moved toward more
support for namespaced keywords, such as in the recent changes
destructuring, and the syntax sugar for maps that have keys with a
common namespace.

Namespaced keywords also make request and response maps unambiguous.
If a map contains `:ring.request/method`, then it must be a request
map; if a map contains `:ring.response/status` then it must be a
response.

It's also possible that we can namespace keys added via middleware,
therefore distinguishing between keys from the adapter, and keys
derived via calculation such as cookies or URL-encoded parameters.

## Backward Compatibility

An key benefit to being able to identify requests and responses is
that we can retain backward compatibility across middleware and
utility functions. We can efficiently distinguish between requests
that adhere to the 1.x specification, and those that adhere to the 2.x
specification, and invoke different behavior depending on the type of
input.

As an example:

```clojure
(defn wrap-example [handler]
  (let [handler-1 (wrap-example-1 handler)
        handler-2 (wrap-example-2 handler)]
    (fn [request]
      (if (:ring.request/method request)
        (handler-2 request)
        (handler-1 request)))))
```

In informal benchmarks, looking up a key in a small request map was
around 6ns. This is relatively little overhead, even across a chain of
middleware functions. Additionally this should lend itself to hardware
branch prediction, as it's expected that an application should use one
version of the Ring spec.

## Required vs. Optional Keys

In the Ring 1 spec there were a number of required keys for both
request and response maps. In the 2.0 spec, this is reduced to one
required key for requests, and one required key for responses.

Example:

```clojure
#:ring.request{:method :get}

#:ring.response{:status 200}
```

Having at least one mandatory key is necessary for efficient
identification of requests and reponses. However, too many
requirements make it difficult to build requests that may have partial
information.

### Required Request Maps Keys

In Ring 1, the `:server-port`, `:server-name` and `:remote-addr`
keys are required. These provide useful information about the
underlying TCP connection, but a HTTP request could be delivered
through a Unix socket, or stored in a file. These aren't necessarily
part of what makes a HTTP request, so they shouldn't be required.

The next required key in Ring 1 is `:uri`. This represents the path
component of the request URI (see the **Key Changes** section). A HTTP
request does not necessarily include a path to a resource. The request
URI, later referred to as the request target, may be "*" or an
authority. For example:

```
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
```

And:

```
CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
```

Again, this means the path should not be required.

The `:scheme` key is required in Ring 1, but again this isn't always
known, as a HTTP request may be recorded in a file or passed through a
proxy. Therefore this key is made optional.


The `:request-method` key is required in Ring 1, and will be required
for Ring 2 also. It's both a madantory part of all HTTP requests,
whatever the version of the protocol, and it's a necessary element to
check. Methods like `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` will always behave
differently to other methods.

The `:protocol` key is part of the request line in HTTP 1.1, and also
part of the connection preface of HTTP/2. It's a known quantity, but
in general not a useful one. We rarely need to know the protocol used
in order to process a HTTP request, and in general there protocol of
the request doesn't affect the content of the response. For this
reason, the protocol is optional in Ring 2.

Finally, the `:headers` key is required in Ring 1, but in Ring 2 it
will be optional, as an empty map of headers can be considered
equivalent to a lack of any header key in the request.

### Required Response Map Keys

The response map in Ring 1 has two required keys: `:status` and
`:headers`.

The status is a mandatory part of a HTTP response, so it
remains a required key in Ring 2.

The headers key will be optional, for the same reasons request headers
have been made optional.

## Namespace Aliasing

Both request and response maps in Ring 2 have protocols that describe
the request and response body. These protocols could be placed in
other namespaces, but as they're a key part of their respective maps,
it's more logical and convenient to place them in `ring.request` and
`ring.response` namespaces

As a side benefit, this allows developers to take advantage of
namespace aliasing to build more concise response maps.

```clojure
(require '[ring.response :as resp])
         
(defn handler [request]
  #::resp{:status  200
          :headers {"content-type" ["text/plain"]}
          :body    "Hello World"})
```

## Key Changes

### :ring.request/body

In Ring 1, the request body is an `java.io.InputStream` object. In
Ring 2, the request body must at least satisfy the
`ring.request/StreamingRequestBody` protocol.

A request body may choose to satify other protocols. In future, a
protocol for asynchronous reads of the request body will be
introduced. However, the fallback of a streaming request protocol will
always be available, at least for any JVM implementations of Ring.

This limits compatibility with platforms that use asynchronous I/O
exclusively, such as ClojureScript. However, we have reader
conditionals for just such cases, and these would need to be used
anyway to selectively remove Ring's synchronous handlers in middleware
and the like.

Having a streaming protocol to fall back on on the JVM is useful for
both being able to quickly read in the request body without requiring
a callback, and because Java servlets also use an `InputStream` to
represent the request body, even for the asynchronous I/O introduced
in the Servlet 3.1 specification.

In practice, this change will make reading the request body slightly
more verbose. Contrast a handler written for Ring 1:

```clojure
(defn handler [request]
  (let [name (-> request :body slurp)] 
    {:status 200, :body (str "Hello " name)}))
```

With a handler written for Ring 2:

  
```clojure
(require '[ring.request :as req]
         '[ring.response :as resp])

(defn handler [request]
  (let [name (-> request :body req/get-body-stream slurp)]
    #::resp{:status 200, :body (str "Hello " name)})
```

While this is somewhat harder to write, it does break Ring's reliance
on blocking I/O. It also allows us to write requests for tests more
easily, as strings can be made to satisfy the protocol. So In Ring 1:

```clojure
(require '[ring.util.io :as rio])

{:request-method :post
 :uri "/"
 :headers {}
 :body (rio/string-input-stream "Hello World")}
```

While in Ring 2:

```clojure
(require '[ring.request :as req])


#::req{:method :post
       :path "/"
       :body "Hello World"}
```

### :ring.request/headers

In Ring 1, request headers are `String` to `String` maps that relate
lowercased header names with their corresponding values.

In HTTP, there can be multiple headers with the same name. For
example:

```
Accept: text/html
Accept: application/json
```

This is equivalent to separating header values with a comma:

```
Accept: text/html, application/json
```

And as header names are case insensitive, this is equivalent to:

```
accept: text/html, application/json
```

In Ring 1, all headers are normalized to this format:

```clojure
{"accept" "text/html, application/json"}
```

The lowercased header names allow for map lookup, and by concatenating
header values we can ensure that all values are strings, making it
easier for developers to deal with the most common case, where a
header will have a single value.

However, this approach prioritizes 'easy' over 'simple'. If there are
multiple headers they have to be joined and then later split apart
once again. And from a semantic point of view, a string is a poor
representation of an ordered collection of values.

In Ring 2, we map a lowercase `String` to a vector of `String`s:

```clojure
{"accept" ["text/html" "application/json"]}
```

This applies even in the single case:

```clojure
{"content-type" ["text/html"]}
```

This does make accessing request headers with single values slightly
more laborious:

```clojure
(first (get-in request [:headers "content-type"]))
```

However, this disadvantage can be offset by utility functions:

```clojure
(get-header request :content-type)
```

It also ensures that you don't accidentally start processing a
concatenated list of header values.

Still to be determined: whether or not an adapter should automatically
split apart concantenated header values.

### :ring.request/method

In Ring 1 this is named `:request-method`. In Ring 2 we can drop the
`request-` part as that is included in the namespace.

### :ring.request/path

In Ring 1 this was named `:uri`. This corresponds to the
`getRequestURI` method of the `HttpServletRequest` class.

However, despite the name, the `getRequestURI` method does not
directly correspond to the `Request-URI` detailed in [RFC 2616][], as
one might expect. Instead, this represents the *path* component of the
request URI, as defined in [RFC 3986][]

In [RFC 7230][] the `Request-URI` is renamed to the `request-target`,
and in HTTP/2 the request target is split into `:path` and
`:authority` pseudo-headers (see [RFC 7540][]).

Given all this, it makes most sense to refer to change the `:uri` key
to `:ring.request/path` in Ring 2, as that's more consistent with
terminology in both the URI RFC and the HTTP/2 RFC.

It should be noted that the `:path` HTTP/2 pseudo-header includes the
query string, while the `path` of a URI excludes it. As the query
string is split out by default by most server implementations, and is
most useful to be considered separately, Ring 2 will keep the path and
query separate.

[RFC 2616]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.2
[RFC 7230]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1
[RFC 7540]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3

### :ring.request/query

In Ring 1 this is named `:query-string`. In [RFC 3986][] this is
referred to as the `query`. For consistency, and because the `-string`
part is somewhat redundant, in Ring 2 this key has been renamed to
`:ring.request/query`.

[RFC 3986]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3

### :ring.response/headers

The Ring 1 specification is very permissable when it comes to response
headers. The header name need not be lowercase, and the header value
may be a string or a vector of strings.

For example, this is a permissible reponse header map:

```clojure
{"x-foo" "1"
 "X-Foo" "2"
 "X-foo" ["3" "4"]}
```

This makes it hard to build middleware that modify the response
headers. By contrast, Ring 2 mandates that response header names be
lowercase, and the values be vectors:

```clojure
{"x-foo" ["1" "2" "3" "4"]}
```

This also ensures that response and request headers have a single,
consistent format.

In HTTP/1 all header names are case insensitive, and in HTTP/2 header
names have to be lowercased.

## Websockets

A Ring websocket API has been discussed a number of times over Ring's
history without a concrete resolution. Previously my feeling was that
websockets were out of scope for Ring, but I've since reconsidered.

Websockets are a separate protocol to HTTP, but they share a common
initial request, and if there is an error or if access is denied, a
HTTP response may be returned instead of a websocket. Given this, it
makes sense to model a websocket as a special kind of response to a
Ring request.

Secondly, no websocket standard has yet emerged outside of
Ring. Current websocket implementations are bespoke, tied to one
particular web server. A websocket abstraction standard would allow
the same websocket code to be used against multiple webservers, and
Ring is a good place for such a standard to live.

### Designs Considered

Many websocket APIs, most notably the one for Javascript, provide some
sort of listener interface where different events are passed to
different methods. In Clojure this approach would be achieved through
a protocol:

```clojure
(require '[ring.websocket :as ws])

(reify ws/Listener
  (on-open    [_ socket] ...)
  (on-message [_ socket message] ...)
  (on-close   [_ socket code reason] ...)
  (on-error   [_ socket throwable] ...))
```

An alternative approach is to have a single function that receives
data from all events:

```clojure
(fn [event]
  (case (::ws/event event)
    :open    ...
    :message ...
    :close   ...
    :error   ...))
```

Equally we can handle sending and closing a channel via a protocol:

```clojure
(reify ws/Listener
  (on-open [_ socket]
    (ws/send socket "Hello")
    (ws/close socket 1000)))
```

Or via a callback that receives a data structure:

```clojure
(fn [event send]
  (send {::ws/text-data "Hello"})
  (send {::ws/close-status 1000}))
```

Or even via two callbacks, one to send and one to close:

```clojure
(fn [event send close]
  (send "Hello")
  (close 1000))
```

Out of these possible designs, Ring 2 has opted to use protocols for
both the listener and the socket. The reason for this design is
covered by the next section.

### Functions vs. Protocols

Ring uses functions and maps to handle HTTP, so the natural question
to ask is: why not use the same design for websockets? Why not use a
function that sends and receives maps, instead of a protocol?

HTTP, even modern versions of it, is a request/response protocol. Each
request to the server results in a corresponding response. Even push
promises don't fundamentally change this; they're just a predictive
tool for sending responses for requests that may occur in future. This
mirrors the operation of function, which takes an argument as input
and returns a value as output.

In contrast to HTTP, a websocket has more than one type of event, and
more than one type of reaction. A message from the client need not
generate a reaction from the server and vice versa. The open and close
events are also often significant for setting up communication between
multiple clients.

So something that is suitable to represent HTTP may not be the right
abstraction to represent a websocket. In the simplest case, a Ring
handler is a function that takes the request as an argument and
returns a response. The design of asynchronous handlers builds upon
that, allowing middleware to be written that can handle both
synchronous and asychronous handlers. However, Websockets have no such
compatibility concerns, so we can consider their design in
isolation.

Protocols have a few advantages that led to their choice in the
specification.

First, protocols are most similar to the design of websockets we see
in Javascript and other languages. While familiarity is not
necessarily a critical consideration, it is a nice bonus.

Second, protocols have more efficient dispatch. Again, this is not a
major consideration as dispatching off a map key isn't that
inefficient, but it is a benefit.

Third, a function can satisfy a protocol, so we can still use
functions that satisfy the listener protocol outlined in the
specification. A function could be simpler interface that targets the
most common use-cases of handling message and close events. For
example:

```clojure
(fn [socket message]
  (ws/send socket message)
  (ws/close socket))
```

In this case the message is either a string, byte array, or `nil` if
the socket is being closed.

Forth, we can partially implement a protocol via reify:

```clojure
(reify ws/Listener
  (on-open [_ socket]
    (ws/send socket "Hello")
    (ws/close socket 1000)))
```

Other methods on the protocol will generate an `AbstractMethodError`
exception when called, which can be ignored by the adapter. When
dealing with a function that handles events, we place the burden of
ignoring irrelevant events on the developer.

Fifth, by using a protocol for output, we can write low-level methods
that can be augmented by higher level functions. For example, a
`close` function can be written that has useful defaults when called
with one argument:

```clojure
(defn close
  ([socket]
   (close socket 1000 "Normal Closure"))
  ([socket code reason
   (send-close socket code reason)))
```

### Methods and Message Types

Some implementations of websocket listeners distinguish between binary
and text messages. In Clojure this might be implemented as:

```clojure
(defprotocol Listener
  (on-binary  [listener socket bytes])
  (on-text    [listener socket string])
  ...)
```

We might also do the same for sending messages:

```clojure
(defprotocol Socket
  (send-binary [socket bytes])
  (send-text   [socket string])
  ...)
```

The advantage of this approach is that it simplifies implementation;
an adapter that supports websockets does not need to dispatch off the
type of the message.

However, by using the more generic `on-message` and `send-message`
methods we open up the possibility of listener middleware. We can wrap
a listener in another listener that adds functionality, such as
automatically serializing data structures to and from JSON or
edn:

```clojure
(wrap-edn-listener
 (reify ws/Listener
   (on-open [_ socket]
     (ws/send socket {:pure "data"})
     (ws/close))))
```

### Websocket Response

In order to distinguish a HTTP response from a websocket response, we
use a distinct key:

```clojure
{:ring.websocket/listener
 (reify ws/Listener
  (on-open [_ socket]
    (ws/send socket "Hello")
    (ws/close socket 1000)))}
```

We use this rather than checking for the protocol itself, as a common
type (such as a function) may satisfy several protocols. Using a
unique key is unambiguous, and keeps the return type (a map) the same

### Compatibility with Serlvets

Websocket support was introduced in the Servlet 3.1 specification.
Unfortunately Java servlets emphasize ease of use over a simple
design, making it hard to write good tooling around them.

That said, there's a lot we can do to facilitate integration in Ring,
and the Ring 2.0 specification is flexible enough to allow websocket
integration in even the most restrictive environments. A request map
needs only the method to be valid, and a request that returns a
websocket must always be a `GET`. Therefore, at minimum, a websocket
request can be:

```clojure
#:ring.request{:method :get}
```

Of course ideally we should also know the path, and it would be nice
to know the headers involved as well. However, having a valid minimal
base is useful for broader integration.

### Compatibility with Channels

There are good tools in Clojure for representing a channel or stream
of messages, such as [core.async][], or Zach Tellman's [Manifold][].

Rather than building a websocket listener directly, we might create a
library that constructs the listener given two core.async channels, or
a single Manifold duplex stream.

```clojure
(fn [request]
  (let [in  (a/chan)
        out (a/chan)]
    (go (let [name (<! in)]
          (>! out (str "Hello " name))
          (a/close! in)
          (a/close! out)))
    #::ws{:listener (websocket-chan-listener in out)}))
```

We might go even further and abstract the entire handler:

```clojure
(websocket-chan-handler
 (fn [in out]
   (go (let [name (<! in)]
         (>! out (str "Hello " name))
         (a/close! in)
         (a/close! out)))))
```

The protocols that Ring presents give us a common basis to build on,
but the interface used by the end developer may look something more
like the above examples.

## Push Promises

HTTP/2 introduced push promises, a predictive optimisation that allows
HTTP responses to be sent to the client before they are requested.
Support for push promises was introduced in Java Servlets 4.0.

The implementation for Ring 2 reuses the `respond` function passed to
asynchronous handlers. Behind the scenes a push request and its
corresponding response are passed to the client, but for the handler
we need only specify the request, since the response can be found by
calling the handler again.

To differentiate the push request from a normal request, the
`ring.push` namespace is used.

The servlet implementation uses a [PushBuilder][] object. Fortunately
this fits in well with Ring's design, allowing for easy integration
with existing servlets.

It's worth noting that [nginx][], a common proxy for Ring applications,
does not support push promises.
